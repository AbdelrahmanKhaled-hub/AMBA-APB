# AMBA-APB
APB Bus Master
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Master module is a Verilog/SystemVerilog design that initiates and controls data transfers to APB slave peripherals.
It follows the AMBA APB protocol defined by ARM and is typically used to connect low-bandwidth peripherals such as timers, UARTs, GPIOs, and SPI controllers.

The master controls the address, data, and control signals required for read and write transactions, ensuring proper timing and handshaking with the APB slave.
